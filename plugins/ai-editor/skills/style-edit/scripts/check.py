plan: every card inside the app's safe zones, vertical cards centred, no card on the head while
it is up (face.json, moved by the zooms or the split window), captions inside the safe zone and
never held long past their words, no stretch with nothing changing on screen, not more text cards
than picture cards, text cards' text at least 34 px, a music bed when the style runs one.
render: the planned music bed is in the render's audio, not silent. On the rendered mp4 (4 samples a second), where the card's drawn pixels are: on the face
(YuNet, face.py), off centre, or not moving. On cut.mp4's audio: silences inside the speech, and
kept spans too short to read as anything but a glitch. Caption words that differ from what the
cut's own transcript heard are listed for a person to look at. Then quality.py: every frame
(freezes, one-frame pops, jitter, a first-frame flash, when each card lands against its word,
static stretches, cuts and cards a minute against style.json), each settled card (text running
into its edge, contrast, the AI-default look), captions (contrast, the frame's edge), loudness, true
peak and each sound cue against the voice, and a render older than what it was made from.

Prints FAIL / WARN / LOOK lines with the time and the fix, writes edits/NAME/check.json
