# Intake questions

The questions start step 2 asks, grouped into at most four per call, and the command that saves each
answer. Ask only the ids `profile.py missing` printed. The first option of each is the one a beginner
can accept as is: list it first and mark it "(Recommended)". Free text ("Other") is always allowed.

The ids are `profile.py`'s two lists: the video questions (`audience`, `names`) and the style questions,
asked once at the end of setup (start asks them only when setup was skipped). Start never asks the video
questions: `profile.py defaults` saves their first options (or keeps the saved answers) and the review page
says what was used; the user changes them by saying so. Keep these calls and their order.

**This video (saved by `defaults`; set only when the user gives one)**

| id | question | options |
|---|---|---|
| `audience` | Who is it for, and what should they do after watching? | free text, one line each. Default: "people curious about the topic" and "follow". Saves `audience` and `goal` in one `set` |
| `names` | Which products, tools, websites or people will you name? | free text, comma separated (add a website for anything not famous). These get their real logos and real page captures |

**Style call 1: what to copy (setup)**

| id | question | options |
|---|---|---|
| `platform` | Where will this be posted? | TikTok, Reels or Shorts (vertical 9:16) / YouTube (wide 16:9) |
| `creators` | Which creators' videos do you want yours to look like? Give 1-3 handles or links. | the creator they named in their message / I'll paste handles / no one: a clean editorial look |
| `creators` (take) | What should we take from each? (multi-select, per creator when there are several) | everything / captions / pace and zooms / visuals and colours |
| `liked_videos` | Any specific videos you love the edit of? Paste 1-5 links (any creator). | skip / I'll paste links |

**Style call 2: what makes it yours (setup)**

| id | question | options |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` (skip when the profile's brand has `kit`: the Brand page's BRAND.md; say "Using your brand kit") | Colours and fonts for the graphics? | use the creator's look (no creator: the clean editorial look) / my brand colours (paste hex codes) and font / a logo file too (give the path) |
| `assets_dir` | Do you have your own photos, screenshots or b-roll for this? | no, find real screenshots and logos / yes, this folder: (path) |
| `avoid` | Anything you never want on screen? (multi-select) | emoji, stock photos, generic icons (all three on by default) / a colour (hex) / other (free text) |
| `captions` | Captions? | like the creator (no creator: "plain white, TikTok Sans", saved the same way) / plain white, TikTok Sans (over a creator's too: `plain`) / bold, a few words at a time / karaoke, the line fills as you speak / minimal / no captions |

**Style call 3: sound and layout (setup)**

| id | question | options |
|---|---|---|
| `sound` | Sound effects and music? | subtle sound effects, music like the creator / sound effects, no music / no sound effects / sound effects and I'll add music myself |
| `behind` | Let graphics sit behind you? (screenshots and logos tuck behind your head and shoulders) | Yes / No, keep them beside and above me |
| `past_edit` | Have a raw take and the version you posted? I can learn how you cut. | No, use the default cut / Yes, I'll give both paths (run the taste skill's "Learn from a past edit", then save `true`) |

Save each call's answers as soon as they come in, all in one command (values are JSON), for example
`python3 "$P" set 'audience="developers who use Claude"' 'goal="follow"' 'names=[{"name": "Jev", "domain": "typesafe.ai"}]'`.
Every argument is `key=value`; the `key value` form below takes one answer alone:

```bash
python3 "$P" set platform '"tiktok"'                      # tiktok | reels | shorts | youtube (sets aspect)
python3 "$P" set creators '[{"handle": "somecreator", "take": ["captions", "pace", "visuals"]}]'
python3 "$P" set liked_videos '["https://www.tiktok.com/@someone/video/123"]'
python3 "$P" set audience '"developers who use Claude"'
python3 "$P" set goal '"follow, then comment router for the guide"'   # saved with audience
python3 "$P" set brand '{"use_creator": true}'           # or {"colors": ["#F2EEE6", "#E5482C"], "font": "Archivo", "logo": "/path/logo.svg"}
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/ai_editor/brandkit.py" import /path/BRAND.md   # a brand file they have: read and saved as brand
python3 "$P" set assets_dir '"/Users/me/Pictures/screens"'
python3 "$P" set 'broll.travel="/Users/me/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-me@gmail.com/My Drive/B-roll/Travel"'   # a b-roll library per type of video (lib/ai_editor/broll.py); set when the user names one
python3 "$P" set names '[{"name": "Jev", "domain": "typesafe.ai"}, {"name": "Claude", "domain": "claude.com"}]'
python3 "$P" set avoid '{"emoji": true, "stock": true, "icons": true, "colors": ["#7B61FF"]}'
python3 "$P" set captions '{"on": true, "style": "creator"}'   # creator | plain | bold | karaoke | minimal; "on": false for none
python3 "$P" set sound '{"sfx": true}'                  # music like the creator; '{"sfx": true, "music": false}' for none
python3 "$P" set behind true                              # false: cards stay beside and above, no cutout step
python3 "$P" set past_edit false                          # true once taste learn.py has run on their edit
```

If the user says "just edit it" or "use the defaults", run `python3 "$P" defaults` and go on. It
saves every unanswered question as its default (vertical, no creator unless named, the
editorial look, emoji, stock and icons avoided, the creator's captions, subtle sound, nothing
behind, no past edit), so they are not asked again. Saving nothing left every style id missing and
start asked them all again on the next video.
