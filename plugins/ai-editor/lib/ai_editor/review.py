                                     `wait` prints the user's Make (TRIALS), Skip, or question (TRIALS ASK);
                                     each render goes up with `alt t1 --video t1.mp4 --trial`
    python3 review.py demo                         self-check on a generated 6 s clip

A note that reads as a lasting preference ("always ...", "never ...", "too many zooms") is offered as a rule: the page
ticks "Keep as a rule for <style>" (POST /keep unticks it) and `wait` marks it [keep as a rule for <style>]. Every
rule `learn` saves (a note at a style scope, or the Teach panel's `--done`) adds a receipt to review.json
("receipts"): the page shows "Saved to <style>: <rule>. Undo", and POST /undo takes a rule that save added out again.

Every round also rewrites <folder>/timings.json: each stage's real time (the cut, the user's review, the edit up to
the stills, the stills check, the render) from the home job and review.json, and once the edit is back the line
the page shows under it, "Made in 6 min (cut 3:10, edit 1:40, render 0:52)". `round --stills` starts the laptop
render in the background (edit.py render --speculative); notes sent on the stills, or Stop, end it.
Every round snapshots the edit's own files (top-level .json/.txt under 2 MB, .sfx/music.wav and the card files plan.json shows) into
review/snap-<stage><round>/, so the page can show what changed ("Changed in this draft": the notes Claude answered,
then cards, zooms, captions, title, music and cut words that differ from the round before, plus each --changed line)
and go back to any round. On the edit, a click on a card, caption, title or zoom on the frame starts a note naming it
(the round's data "items"), and `wait` prints what is on screen at each note ([caption '...'], [zoom ...]).
Each round also gets review/data-<stage><round>.json for the page, built from the edit folder when
the files are there: the cut's transcript with every cut word and pause struck (decisions.json +
words.raw.json), the timeline's segments (cut points, or chapters.txt on the edit), and the edit's
Cards / Zooms / Captions tracks (plan.json). A missing file leaves that part out.
A note saved while a round is with Claude (after send) is queued for the next round: "queued": true, round
n+1. `wait` never sees it. `round` makes it an open note of the new round, moved to where the same words
are said when both rounds have the cut's transcript (else at the same time), with a new frame still.
Stop merges queued notes into the reopened round.
`status` exits 3 with STOPPED when the user pressed Stop on the page: stop the round and run `wait`.
The Transcript tab (cut stage) restores or cuts words: POST /edits {"restore": [[s, e]], "cut": [[s, e]]} in raw-take
seconds (and "pause": removed pauses to put back) rewrites spans.json and keep.json (apply_edits; *.prev.json kept) and `wait` prints "EDITS <n> transcript edits applied
to spans.json: rebuild, render, verify, round". Stop puts spans.prev.json and keep.prev.json back.

`wait` exits when the user presses send or approve, and prints every note of the round: its time,
the text, the words being said, the card on screen (from plan.json) and the frame still's path.
While `wait` runs the page says Claude is listening; without it the notes still save, and the next
`wait` returns at once with them.

The server listens on 127.0.0.1 only, and every request needs the random token in the URL it
prints (then a SameSite cookie), as preview.py does: another page open in the browser cannot read
the notes or press send.
